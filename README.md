# Voice Agent Lab – ElevenLabs

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive voice agent using the ElevenLabs.io free voice agent platform. The agent is designed to answer questions, guide conversations, and provide accurate information using a structured knowledge base and clearly defined conversation branches. No coding was required for this project.

The purpose of this lab was to explore how AI voice tools can be used efficiently while adapting to frequently changing interfaces, an essential skill when working with modern AI systems.

## Voice Agent Description
**Agent Name:** Campus Info Voice Assistant  

**Purpose:**  
The Campus Info Voice Assistant helps students and campus visitors quickly access information about campus services, admissions, policies, and general questions through natural voice interaction.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Answers factual questions using a defined knowledge base
- Routes conversations based on user intent
- Provides step-by-step guidance for “how-to” questions
- Handles FAQ and policy-related questions clearly
- Gracefully redirects out-of-scope requests

---

## Knowledge Base
The agent was built using multiple knowledge sources totaling approximately 3–4 KB of content. These sources included:
- Campus overview and general services
- Admissions and enrollment FAQs
- Student support services
- Campus policies and event information

The knowledge base content was selected for clarity, relevance, and effectiveness in voice-based interactions.

## Conversation Branches
The agent uses multiple conversation branches to handle different user intents:

1. **General Information** – High-level explanations about the campus and available services  
2. **How-To / Problem Solving** – Step-by-step guidance for tasks such as applying or contacting advising  
3. **FAQ / Policy Questions** – Direct answers to rules, deadlines, and requirements  

These branches allow the agent to guide conversations naturally while remaining accurate and efficient.

## Reflection Questions

### Branch Design Challenge
The most challenging part of designing the conversation branches was anticipating the many ways users might phrase similar requests. This showed that voice agents rely heavily on intent recognition rather than rigid scripts, making clear prompts and examples critical for smooth conversation flow.

### Knowledge Base Impact
The structure and clarity of the knowledge base had a major impact on the agent’s responses. Concise, factual, and FAQ-style content worked best, while overly long or vague information reduced response accuracy. Well-organized content significantly improved response quality.

### Real-World Application
This type of voice agent would be valuable in industries such as education, customer service, and healthcare. For example, a university could use a similar agent to answer admissions and student service questions 24/7, reducing staff workload while improving accessibility.
